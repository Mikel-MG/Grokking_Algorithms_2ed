Since computers are physical objects, when we look for a node in a tree, a physical object has to move to retrieve that data; this overhead is called *seek time*. Seek time can be a big factor in how fast or slow an algorithm is.\n",

B-trees have larger nodes, where each node can have many more keys and children than a binary tree. Thus, we spend more time reading each node, *but we seek less because we read more data in one go*. This is what makes B-trees faster. B-trees are a popular data structure for databases, which is no surprise as databases spend a lot of time retrieving data from a disk."
