    "Now, how is it possible that both these trees have a performance of $O(\\log_{n})$, if performance in trees is tied to height? The answer is related to the base of the log operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perfectly balanced tree has a performance of $O(\\log_{n})$, where the base of the log is 2, just like binary search. This can be intuitively deduced from the fact that each level doubles the nodes plus one. Thus, a perfectly balanced tree of height 1 has 3 nodes, of height 2 has 7 nodes, of height 3 has 15, and so on. In other words, each layer adds a number of nodes equal to a power of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the AVL tree has some gaps on it, so each level adds fewer than double the nodes. This is why their performance is also $O(\\log_{n})$, but the log base is phi ($\\phi$, also known as the golden ratio, ~1.618).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, AVL trees do not offer exactly as good performance as perfectly balanced trees, but the performance is very close, since both are $O(\\log_{n})$."
